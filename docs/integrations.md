# Integrations

Single doc covering all four external systems Arrears touches in POC: LWCA Accounting API, Rentancy API, Microsoft Graph (Outlook), and Anthropic API. Each section is endpoints + auth + how we map into the canonical model.

For cross-cutting credential lifecycle (refresh-token mechanics, encryption), see `docs/auth-and-credentials.md`.

## 1. LWCA — Accounting API

Spring Boot monolith. Stage URL: `https://loftyworks-accounting.stage.pay.loftyworks.com`. OAuth2/Cognito JWT bearer (the **ID token**, not the access token — see "Authentication" below).

We deliberately do **not** call the `arrears` endpoint LWCA exposes. We derive arrears from the invoice endpoint so the rule for "what counts as arrears" lives entirely in Arrears and is identical across Phase 2 sources.

### Endpoints used

| Method | Path                            | When                                                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/v1/api/invoice`               | Polling — list invoices in arrears states for a configured organisation     |
| GET    | `/v1/api/invoice` (probe)       | Credential setup — `limit=1` call to validate the JWT works                 |
| GET    | `/v1/api/invoice/{id}/lineitems`| On demand — when reviewer opens a case detail page (used to enrich display) |

### Listing arrears

```
GET /v1/api/invoice
  ?type=OUTBOUND
  &isArrear=true
  &statuses=UNPAID,PARTIALLY_PAID,PARTIALLY_RECONCILED
  &page=1
  &size=100
  &sort=due_date,asc
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <id_token>
```

`isArrear=true` on LWCA's side is the same condition we'd apply anyway: `remainAmount > 0 AND paymentCycleType != RECURRING`. We send it because it shrinks the page; we still re-verify on our side so a future change in LWCA semantics doesn't silently break our rule.

`type=OUTBOUND` selects invoices the agency raises *outward* to tenants (rent and tenant charges). The naming is the agency's POV: "outbound" = "owed to us". INBOUND = bills the agency receives from landlords/contractors, irrelevant to tenant arrears chasing. (The Lofty stage UI uses the same `type=OUTBOUND` filter for its arrears view, which is how we confirmed the contract.)

Pagination is **1-indexed** on stage — `page=0` returns `400 Validation failed: page: must be greater than or equal to 1`.

Response is the paginated `PagedResponse<InvoiceApiResponse>` defined in `loftyworks-accounting/src/main/java/com/moatable/loftyworks/accounting/invoice/api/response/InvoiceApiResponse.java`. Shape we care about, per item:

```json
{
  "id": "1e8f...",                  // → Charge.lwcaInvoiceId
  "organisationId": "...",
  "referenceId": "INV-12345",
  "grossAmount": 120000,            // pence, BigInteger → Charge.grossAmountPence
  "remainAmount": 80000,            // pence → Charge.lastKnownRemainAmountPence
  "dueDate": "2025-04-01",          // ISO date → Charge.dueDate
  "invoiceDate": "2025-03-15",
  "status": "PARTIALLY_PAID",       // → Charge.lastKnownStatus
  "paymentCycleType": "MONTHLY",    // → Charge.lastKnownPaymentCycleType (RECURRING gets filtered out)
  "property": {                     // → denormalised onto Tenancy when refreshed
    "propertyId": "...",
    "propertyName": "Flat 2, ...",
    "propertyAddress1": "12 High Street",
    "propertyAddress2": "London"
  },
  "payer": {                        // tenant
    "payerId": "...",               // we don't store this directly — Rentancy contactId is source of truth
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Tenant"
  },
  "tenancyId": "...",               // → Charge.case.tenancyId (after we open/find the case)
  "type": "RENT",
  "payeeType": "LANDLORD"
}
```

### Refreshing a single invoice (for live-balance checks)

```
GET /v1/api/invoice?type=INBOUND&propertyIds=<id>&statuses=UNPAID,PARTIALLY_PAID,PARTIALLY_RECONCILED,PAID,RECONCILED&size=200
```

There is no `GET /v1/api/invoice/{id}` for a single invoice fetch in the controller we read. To refresh one invoice's balance we either:

1. Re-list with a tight filter (cheap, works), or
2. Cache an in-memory result for a short TTL (e.g. 30 seconds) when multiple rules ask for the same invoice during one approval action

POC: option 1, no caching. If perf hurts we add the TTL cache. The "no caching" rule applies to *persistence*, not to a request-scoped value held in memory for the duration of one action.

### Mapping → canonical

| LWCA field                         | Canonical destination                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `invoice.id`                       | `Charge.lwcaInvoiceId` (unique)                      |
| `invoice.organisationId`           | `Charge.organisationId`                              |
| `invoice.grossAmount`              | `Charge.grossAmountPence`                            |
| `invoice.remainAmount`             | `Charge.lastKnownRemainAmountPence`                  |
| `invoice.dueDate`                  | `Charge.dueDate`                                     |
| `invoice.invoiceDate`              | `Charge.invoiceDate`                                 |
| `invoice.status`                   | `Charge.lastKnownStatus`                             |
| `invoice.paymentCycleType`         | `Charge.lastKnownPaymentCycleType` (filter RECURRING)|
| `invoice.tenancyId`                | `Case.tenancyId` (case lookup or open)               |
| `invoice.property.*`               | `Tenancy.property*` (denormalised on refresh)        |

Mapper: `backend/src/integrations/lwca/lwca-invoice.mapper.ts`. Exports `toCanonicalCharge(invoice, orgId)`. Tested with full LWCA fixture in `fixtures/lwca/invoices-list.json`.

### Stage shape divergences (May 2026)

The LWCA stage HTTP response diverges from the canonical envelope the fixture uses. `backend/src/integrations/lwca/lwca-stage-shape.ts` normalises before Zod parsing so a single schema handles both paths.

| Wire field (stage)   | Canonical field          | Notes |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ | --- |
| `returnList[]`       | `content[]`              | Page envelope key |
| `page`               | `number`                 | Same value, different key |
| `totalItems`         | `totalElements`          | Page envelope key |
| `tenancy.id`         | `tenancyId` (row-level)  | Top-level `tenancyId` is always null on stage — the real id sits nested under `tenancy: { id, reference, balance }` |

Tenancy-less invoices (where neither `tenancyId` nor `tenancy.id` resolves to a string) are dropped by the mapper: the chase pipeline is keyed on tenancies, so there's nothing actionable to do with an unallocated charge. Stage exposes a fair number of these — they're unallocated/ad-hoc charges from the agency's ledger.



### Filtering rule on read

After receiving the response, the mapper applies these on the Arrears side regardless of what LWCA returned:

```
ignore if status == DELETED
ignore if paymentCycleType == RECURRING        // recurring templates, not actual charges
ignore if remainAmount <= 0                    // no outstanding balance
ignore if dueDate is null                      // shouldn't happen, but be safe
```

Anything passing these is a real arrear we own a case for.

### Authentication

Cognito-issued JWT in `Authorization: Bearer ...`. Token belongs to a service user on Lofty's stage Cognito pool, scoped to the organisation being polled. Refresh handled per `docs/auth-and-credentials.md`.

### Errors

| Code   | Meaning                              | Arrears response                                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 401    | Token invalid or expired             | One forced refresh + retry; on second 401 → `CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED` flag, halt polling for that org |
| 403    | Token valid but no access to org     | Mark credential row stale; surface in UI as "credential lacks access"; halt polling |
| 404    | Org not found                        | Mark credential row stale; halt polling                          |
| 429    | Rate limited                         | Exponential backoff inside the polling job; not propagated as user error |
| 5xx    | LWCA down                            | `SyncJobRun.status = FAILED`; next tick retries; no user alert   |

Backoff schedule for 429 / 5xx: 1s, 4s, 16s, then give up this tick.

## 2. Rentancy API

Lambda + DynamoDB. Stage URL: `https://rentancy-api.stage.pay.loftyworks.com`. Same Cognito user pool as LWCA (confirmed via probe).

### Endpoints used

| Method | Path                                                                              | When                                              |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/v2/organisations/{organisationId}/tenancies/{tenancyId}`                        | When opening a new case; periodic refresh        |
| GET    | `/v2/organisations/{organisationId}/contacts/{contactId}`                         | After getting tenancy, for tenants + guarantors  |
| GET    | `/v2/organisations/{organisationId}/tenancies?limit=1`                            | Credential probe                                  |

### Fetching tenancy

Shape from `rentancy-api/src/v2/tenancies/`:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "tenancyPropertyId": "...",
  "status": "ACTIVE",                  // → Tenancy.status (mapped to ACTIVE/ENDED/UNKNOWN)
  "reference": "TN-2024-...",
  "paymentDay": 1,                     // → Tenancy.rentDayOfMonth
  "tenants": ["contactId1", "contactId2"],     // → TenancyContact rows with role=TENANT
  "guarantorIds": ["contactId3"],              // → TenancyContact rows with role=GUARANTOR
  "isRentGuaranteeRequired": false,
  "askingPrice": 120000,
  "agreedPrice": 120000,               // → Tenancy.rentAmountPence (informational only)
  "additionalCosts": [],
  "startDate": "2024-09-01",
  "endDate": null
}
```

Both `guarantorIds` and `guarantors` fields appear in the schema (legacy + canonical). The mapper reads `guarantorIds ?? guarantors ?? []` and dedupes.

### Fetching contact

Shape from `rentancy-api/src/v2/contacts/`:

```json
{
  "id": "...",
  "fname": "Jane",                   // → Contact.firstName
  "sname": "Tenant",                 // → Contact.lastName
  "companyName": null,
  "emails": [
    { "type": "PERSONAL", "email": "jane@example.com" },   // first one → Contact.primaryEmail
    { "type": "WORK", "email": "j.tenant@work.co.uk" }
  ],
  "phones": [
    { "type": "MOBILE", "phone": "+447700900000" }
  ]
}
```

`primaryEmail` policy: first email in the array. If we later want a marked-as-primary flag, we add it here, not in `Contact`.

### Mapping → canonical

| Rentancy field                          | Canonical destination                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `tenancy.id`                            | `Tenancy.id`                                    |
| `tenancy.paymentDay`                    | `Tenancy.rentDayOfMonth`                        |
| `tenancy.agreedPrice`                   | `Tenancy.rentAmountPence`                       |
| `tenancy.status`                        | `Tenancy.status` (uppercase, mapped)            |
| `tenancy.tenants[]`                     | `TenancyContact` rows, role=`TENANT`            |
| `tenancy.guarantorIds[] ?? guarantors[]`| `TenancyContact` rows, role=`GUARANTOR`         |
| `contact.fname`                         | `Contact.firstName`                             |
| `contact.sname`                         | `Contact.lastName`                              |
| `contact.emails[0].email`               | `Contact.primaryEmail`                          |
| `contact.emails`                        | `Contact.emailsJson` (verbatim)                 |
| `contact.phones`                        | `Contact.phonesJson` (verbatim)                 |

### Stage shape divergences (May 2026)

Rentancy stage diverges from the canonical schema in two ways. `backend/src/integrations/rentancy/rentancy-stage-shape.ts` normalises before parsing.

| Wire field (stage)                                  | Canonical field        | Notes |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | --- |
| `tenancy.tenants[]: { tenantId, primary }`          | `tenants: string[]`    | Stage returns tenant objects; the adapter extracts the `tenantId`. `guarantorIds` / `guarantors` follow the same shape (looks for `id`, `tenantId`, `guarantorId`, `contactId`). |
| `contact.firstName` / `contact.lastName`            | `fname` / `sname`      | Stage uses camelCase; canonical and the fixture use the shorter form. |


Property details come from LWCA's `invoice.property` block, not from Rentancy. Both repos have property concepts; LWCA's is sufficient for our display needs.

### When we fetch

- **On case open:** one fetch of the tenancy + one fetch per contact in `tenants` and `guarantorIds`. Persisted.
- **`RentancyTenancyRefreshJob` (hourly):** for every tenancy with an active case, re-fetch tenancy + all contacts. Cheap, ensures contact email changes pick up.
- **On reviewer "refresh" button** on case detail: same as above, on demand.

### Authentication

Same JWT as LWCA. Working assumption: identical token works on both APIs because they share the Cognito pool.

If they don't (TBC), the `OrganisationCredential` row gains a second token pair and `withFreshAccessToken(orgId, target)` takes a `target: 'lwca' | 'rentancy'` argument. We'll know at first probe.

### Errors

Same handling as LWCA except 404 on a specific tenancy/contact: log, mark missing on the case, do not halt polling. Tenants leave, tenancies get deleted; this is expected.

## 3. Microsoft Graph — Outlook

Single shared mailbox serves all configured organisations in POC. App-level credentials (no per-organisation tokens).

### Permissions required

- `Mail.Read` — list and read messages from the shared mailbox
- `Mail.Send` — send as the shared mailbox
- `Mail.ReadWrite` — mark messages read, move to "Processed" folder

All scoped via `ApplicationAccessPolicy` to the one shared mailbox UPN. Granted by an Azure AD admin once during setup. After that, the app runs with client credentials (no user sign-in).

### Endpoints used

| Method | Path                                                                                       | When                          |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| GET    | `/v1.0/users/{mailbox}/mailFolders/Inbox/messages?$filter=receivedDateTime ge {since}&$top=50&$orderby=receivedDateTime asc` | Inbound poll (every 5 min) |
| GET    | `/v1.0/users/{mailbox}/messages/{id}`                                                       | Fetch full body for processing |
| POST   | `/v1.0/users/{mailbox}/sendMail`                                                            | Approved outbound             |
| POST   | `/v1.0/users/{mailbox}/messages/{id}/move`                                                  | Move to "Processed" after ingestion |
| PATCH  | `/v1.0/users/{mailbox}/messages/{id}` `{ isRead: true }`                                   | Mark as read on ingestion     |

### Inbound polling

Poll every 5 minutes. Cursor is the most recent `receivedDateTime` we successfully ingested, persisted on `SyncJobRun` and on a singleton `outlook_poll_cursor` row.

```
1. since = max(cursor - 2 min overlap, now - 24h)
2. list messages with receivedDateTime ≥ since
3. for each message (oldest first):
     idempotency: skip if outlookMessageId already exists in Communication
     fetch full body (bodyPreview is truncated; we need full)
     match sender email → Contact (organisationId-aware lookup on primaryEmail; fallback secondary emails)
     route to InboundPipeline (see architecture.md flow 3)
     mark as read; move to "Processed" subfolder
4. advance cursor to max receivedDateTime processed
```

2-minute overlap is to handle Graph's eventual consistency — messages sometimes appear after their `receivedDateTime` has passed. Idempotency on `outlookMessageId` makes the overlap free of side effects.

### Sender matching

```
1. normalise sender email (lowercase, strip plus-addressing)
2. lookup Contact by (organisationId, primaryEmail) — but we don't know orgId yet
   ⇒ lookup across all Contact rows where primaryEmail matches
3. if exactly one match: route to that org/case
4. if multiple matches across organisations: log "ambiguous sender", do not route, surface on a "needs triage" admin page
5. if no primary-email match: search emailsJson for a secondary match; same logic
6. if no match anywhere: mark Communication as orphan with the raw sender stored, do not link to a case
```

For POC the "needs triage" page can be a simple list. Ambiguous senders are expected to be rare with the small scope.

### Outbound send

Triggered by review queue approval. Body is HTML (rendered from Markdown via `marked`). Plain-text fallback auto-generated.

```json
{
  "message": {
    "subject": "Reminder: rent payment overdue — total £2,400 outstanding",
    "body": { "contentType": "HTML", "content": "<p>Dear Jane,...</p>" },
    "toRecipients": [{ "emailAddress": { "address": "jane@example.com" } }]
  },
  "saveToSentItems": true
}
```

`saveToSentItems: true` so handlers can see what went out in the shared mailbox's Sent folder, not just in our DB.

### Authentication

Microsoft Graph SDK with client credentials (`@azure/identity` `ClientSecretCredential`). Tokens cached by the SDK; we don't manage refresh.

Env / Secrets Manager:

- `OUTLOOK_TENANT_ID`
- `OUTLOOK_CLIENT_ID`
- `OUTLOOK_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `OUTLOOK_SHARED_MAILBOX` — UPN like `arrears-test@<lofty-tenant>.com`

### Local mode — Mailhog

When `OUTBOUND_MODE=mailhog`:

- Inbound polling still goes against real Graph (or `INTEGRATION_MODE=fixtures` to use seeded fixtures)
- Outbound send goes through nodemailer SMTP to `localhost:1025`
- Mailhog UI at `localhost:8025` shows captured messages

When `OUTBOUND_MODE=outlook`: real send via Graph. Used only when intentionally testing the send path.

## 4. Anthropic API

Direct via `@anthropic-ai/sdk`. Two model uses, both documented in detail in `docs/ai-decision-spec.md`. This section covers the integration mechanics only.

### Models in POC

- **Classification:** `claude-haiku-4-5` — fast and cheap, good enough for sentiment + intent on short tenant messages
- **Drafting:** `claude-sonnet-4-6` — better at tone matching and producing emails a human would actually approve

Model names live in `OrganisationConfig` so we can swap per-org without redeploying. Validated against an allowlist at request time.

### Client wrapper

`AnthropicClient` in `backend/src/integrations/anthropic/` is the only place `@anthropic-ai/sdk` is imported. Responsibilities:

1. Model name validation
2. Spend cap enforcement (read daily total from `classification_result.estimatedCostPence` aggregate, refuse new calls if over `ANTHROPIC_SPEND_CAP_GBP_DAILY`)
3. Pricing table for cost estimation per model
4. Logging (`prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens`, `model`, `latencyMs`, `costPence`)
5. Retry on 429 / 5xx — 3 attempts with exponential backoff
6. PII redaction enforcement: refuses to send a prompt unless it passes through `Redactor.assertSafe(prompt)`

### Cost estimation

```
costPence =
  promptTokens * promptPricePencePerMillion / 1_000_000 +
  completionTokens * completionPricePencePerMillion / 1_000_000
```

Prices are configured per model in `backend/src/integrations/anthropic/pricing.ts`. Updated manually when Anthropic publishes new pricing. Verified against the latest published rates during initial setup.

### Errors

- Spend cap exceeded → typed error `AnthropicSpendCapExceeded`; inbound pipeline routes to `INBOUND_LOW_CONFIDENCE` review item with reason "spend cap exceeded"
- Rate limited → SDK handles with retry; if exhausted, same as above
- Model rejected output (content filter) → log full input, route to `INBOUND_LOW_CONFIDENCE`
- Network failure → 3 retries then route to `INBOUND_LOW_CONFIDENCE`

In every failure mode the inbound message still goes to the review queue. The AI is best-effort; the system never silently drops a message.

## 5. Probe contract for credential setup

When an admin saves credentials on the org config page, the system runs a probe to validate the JWT works before persisting. Probe is a no-side-effect operation against each upstream.

```ts
// backend/src/modules/organisations/credential-probe.service.ts
async function probe(orgId: string, accessToken: string): Promise<ProbeResult> {
  const results = await Promise.allSettled([
    lwcaInvoiceClient.probe(orgId, accessToken),       // GET /v1/api/invoice?limit=1
    rentancyTenancyClient.probe(orgId, accessToken),   // GET /v2/organisations/{orgId}/tenancies?limit=1
  ]);
  return {
    lwca: toStatus(results[0]),
    rentancy: toStatus(results[1]),
    overall: results.every(r => r.status === 'fulfilled' && r.value.ok) ? 'OK' : 'FAILED',
  };
}
```

UI surfaces both results side by side. Admin can save anyway if one fails (with a confirmation modal) — useful if e.g. Rentancy is temporarily down but they want to set up LWCA polling.

## 6. Fixtures

Every integration has a fixtures folder with representative payloads. Set `INTEGRATION_MODE=fixtures` and the integration clients read from disk instead of HTTP. Used by tests and by offline dev.

```

The Outlook fixtures are raw `.eml` so they can be opened in any mail client to inspect, but they're consumed by tests as parsed JSON (subject, from, to, body).

## Open items (TBC)

These don't block build. Stubs and assumptions noted in code:

- Rentancy stage base URL — confirm with platform team
- Cognito pool sharing between LWCA and Rentancy — confirm; affects whether `OrganisationCredential` needs one or two token pairs
- Outlook shared mailbox UPN — provisioning underway
- Anthropic API key — using personal/dev key until billing assigned
